Key:
- r = radius of linear sprocket
- angle = angle of the linear axis
- rotations = rotations of the linear axis motor
- R = length of the middle arm bar
- length = length of the bar connecting the four-bar to the linear part + the length of the bar that connects the four bar to the claw
- armAngle = angle of the four-bar part

Kinematics equations:
- linear motion
    - rotation -> linear (chain and sprocket) 2(pi)r in/rotation
    - linear -> 2d (frame is on an angle) x = 2pir * cos(angle) * rotations y = 2pir * sin(angle) * rotations
- virtual 4-bar motion
    - rotation -> 2d translation (chain and two locked sprockets) 2piR

- Combined
[x,y] = [(2pir * cos(angle) * rotations) + (cos(armAngle) * R) - (length), (2pir * sin(angle) * rotations) + (sin(armAngle) * R)]


Inverse equations:
- linear motion
- virtual 4-bar motion

Note:
- singularity filtering
